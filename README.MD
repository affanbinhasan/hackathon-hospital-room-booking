# Hospital Room Booking App

# Context

- Patients face a lot of problems after their appointment to look for available rooms. They have to talk to different departments inside hospital to get it booked, and still don't get a room of their choice.

- We propose an app which can be used internally by Hospitals to allow patients to minimize the hassle of room booking.

# Description

- This app allows patients to book available room of their choice after their appointment is booked. They can login and enter their appointment number to proceed with Booking their room based on availability.

# Implementation

# Client-Side (Hospital)

- Client will have an admin privilege of the app and they'll be allowed to create, update and delete the data.

- Client can allow or refuse room booking request.

# User-Side (Patient)

- Users will  be granted user access and they will be allowed to view, book or cancel the booking.
